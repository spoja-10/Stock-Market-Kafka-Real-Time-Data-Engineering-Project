# 📈 Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project

## 🚀 Introduction

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline** using **Apache Kafka** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
The goal is to stream, process, and analyze **live stock market data** by integrating data ingestion, storage, cataloging, and querying in a scalable cloud-based architecture.

It highlights modern data engineering practices such as:

* Real-time data streaming
* Cloud-based storage and processing
* Automated schema discovery and metadata management
* Interactive querying and analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka
* **Cloud Services**:

  * **Amazon S3** – Storage for raw and processed data
  * **AWS Glue Crawler & Catalog** – Schema discovery and metadata management
  * **Amazon Athena** – Serverless querying using SQL
  * **Amazon EC2** – Kafka cluster deployment and compute resources
